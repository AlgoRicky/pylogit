This project has been assisted by numerous individuals and organizations.

Akshay Vij contributed code that was the basis for the conditional logit code, and he provided the
motivation and guidance behind the use of "mapping matrices" that is standard throughout PyLogit.

John Canny advised Akshay Vij on optimizing the code used for the conditional logit, and as such
he also helped the development of this package.

Paul Waddell has graciously provided the financial support that helped ensure continued progress on
this package.
